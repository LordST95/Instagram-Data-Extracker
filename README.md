# Instagram-Data-Extracker

Some years ago I just want to write a simple app to Analyze
my Instagram info, I postponed my willing until now that I heard
Instagram wanna put some limits on its API.

By the way ...

with this simple code, u can see ur connection with people in csv
file and see who liked which one of ur posts.


working with this code is easy, u should install instagram_private_api
with pip and then fill user_name and password in InstaAnalyzer then
run the code with python, that's it :))
