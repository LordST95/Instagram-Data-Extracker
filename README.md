# Instagram Data Extractor

Some years ago I just want to write a simple app to Analyze
my Instagram info, I postponed my willing until now that I heard
Instagram wanna put some limits on its API.

By the way ...

with these files, u can see ur connection with people in csv
file and see who liked which one of ur posts, your activity on Instagram 
and ur story's visitors.


I know these files need some refactoring but for now I have not chance to do so.

working with them is easy, u should install instagram_private_api
with pip and then fill user_name and password in for example in InstaAnalyzer.py then
run the code with python, that's it :))
